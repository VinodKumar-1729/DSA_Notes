### **1. Definition and Basic Properties**
- A **binary tree** is a data structure in which each node has **at most two children** (commonly called **left** and **right**).
- **Root Node**: The topmost node.
- **Leaf Node**: Nodes without children.
- **Internal Nodes**: Nodes with at least one child.
- **Height** of a binary tree: The longest path from the root to a leaf.
  - For a tree with `n` nodes, height can be as low as `O(log n)` (balanced tree) or as high as `O(n)` (skewed tree).
- **Types of Binary Trees**:
  - **Full Binary Tree**: Each node has either 0 or 2 children.
  - **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and nodes are as far left as possible.
  - **Perfect Binary Tree**: A full binary tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level.
  - **Balanced Binary Tree**: Any binary tree where the difference in height between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one.

### **2. Traversal Methods**
Traversal refers to visiting each node in a specific order:

- **In-order (Left, Root, Right)**:
  - Produces a sorted order of values if applied to a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.
  - Time Complexity: `O(n)`.
  - **Applications**: Sorting elements, retrieving elements in non-decreasing order.

- **Pre-order (Root, Left, Right)**:
  - Visits the root node before the left and right subtrees.
  - Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
  - Common in **expression trees** to retrieve prefix expressions.
  - Time Complexity: `O(n)`.

- **Post-order (Left, Right, Root)**:
  - Visits children before the parent node.
  - Useful in **deleting or freeing nodes** as it deletes children first, then the root.
  - Used in **expression trees** for evaluating postfix expressions.
  - Time Complexity: `O(n)`.

### **3. Common Operations**
- **Insertion**:
  - Complexity: `O(log n)` on average for balanced trees.
  - In an unbalanced tree, it can degrade to `O(n)`.
  - **Balanced Trees** (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees) are preferable when searching is frequent as they maintain `O(log n)` height.

- **Searching**:
  - Complexity: `O(log n)` in a balanced binary tree.
  - **Worst-case** complexity is `O(n)` for a skewed tree (like a linked list).
  - For **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, searching is efficient due to the ordered structure (left < root < right).

### **4. Additional Binary Tree Types**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - A binary tree where the left child’s key is less than the parent’s, and the right child’s key is greater than the parent’s.
  - Ensures **logarithmic time complexity** for insert, delete, and search operations in the average case.
  - Commonly used for **dynamic sets** and **lookup tables**.

- **Balanced Binary Trees**:
  - Types include **AVL trees** and **Red-Black trees**, which self-balance to ensure `O(log n)` operations.
  - AVL Trees strictly maintain a balance factor (difference in heights of left and right subtrees) of -1, 0, or +1 for all nodes.
  - Red-Black Trees enforce a balanced structure using coloring rules, leading to balanced height.

### **5. Important Concepts and Properties**
- **Depth of a Node**: Number of edges from the root to the node.
- **Height of a Node**: Number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.
- **Complete Binary Tree Property**: For a complete binary tree with `n` nodes:
  - The number of nodes at the last level can be calculated as `n - 2^(h) + 1`, where `h` is the height of the tree.
- **Binary Tree Representation**:
  - **Linked List**: Each node has a pointer to its left and right children.
  - **Array Representation**:
    - Root node is at index 0.
    - For a node at index `i`, the left child is at `2*i + 1`, and the right child is at `2*i + 2`.
    - Useful for complete binary trees, especially **heap** structures.

### **6. Out-of-the-Box Points for Competitive Exams**
- **Binary Tree Node Count Formula**:
  - The number of nodes `N` in a perfect binary tree of height `h` is given by: \( N = 2^{(h + 1)} - 1 \).
  - This formula helps quickly determine the node count when the height is known.
  
- **Height Calculation**:
  - For an almost complete binary tree, **logarithmic height** ensures efficient insertions, deletions, and searches.
  
- **Binary Tree Applications**:
  - **Huffman Coding Trees**: Used in data compression algorithms.
  - **Expression Trees**: Used to represent arithmetic expressions.
  - **Binary Heaps**: A type of binary tree used in implementing priority queues.
  
- **Advanced Traversal Techniques**:
  - **Morris Traversal**: A traversal technique that allows in-order traversal without using extra space (O(1) space complexity).
  - **Threaded Binary Trees**: Specially designed to make in-order traversal more efficient by making use of null pointers.

### **7. Binary Tree in Real-World Applications**
- **Database Indexing**: Often utilizes B-trees, which are balanced, multi-level binary trees that facilitate fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Binary trees are used in decision-making processes like decision trees in machine learning.
- **Compilers**: Syntax trees (a type of binary tree) represent the grammatical structure of source code.

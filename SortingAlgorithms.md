### 1. **Bubble Sort**
   - **Concept**: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm where adjacent elements are repeatedly swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each pass.
   - **Time Complexity**:
     - **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.
     - **Average/Worst Case**: O(n²) due to nested loops.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it requires no additional memory except for a few auxiliary variables.
   - **Stability**: Bubble Sort is stable, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements.
   - **In-Place Sorting**: It sorts in-place, as it does not require additional memory space for sorting.
   - **Exam Insight**: Though Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets, it is often a topic for theoretical and coding questions in exams due to its simplicity and foundational nature.
   - **Optimization**: The algorithm can be optimized by observing whether a pass required any swaps. If no swaps were made, the list is already sorted, allowing for an early exit.

### 2. **Merge Sort**
   - **Concept**: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the sorted array.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - **Best, Average, and Worst Case**: O(n log n), as each division and merge takes linear time.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n), as it requires extra space for merging the sorted subarrays.
   - **Stability**: Merge Sort is stable, maintaining the order of equal elements in the sorted array.
   - **In-Place Sorting**: Not in-place, as it requires additional storage for merging.
   - **Use Cases**: Merge Sort performs well with large datasets and is often used when the data is too large to fit into memory (i.e., external sorting).
   - **Exam Insight**: Key points to remember are its stable sorting property and consistent O(n log n) complexity across all cases.
   - **Additional Detail**: Merge Sort is highly suitable for linked lists, as the merging process can be performed in-place, avoiding extra space requirements.

### 3. **Quick Sort**
   - **Concept**: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the array into two subarrays around a pivot element, such that elements less than the pivot come before it and those greater come after. It recursively sorts the subarrays.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - **Average Case**: O(n log n), as the array is divided into halves with each pass.
     - **Worst Case**: O(n²), which occurs when the pivot selection is poor, such as the smallest or largest element in a sorted or nearly sorted array.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(log n) on average for the recursive stack.
   - **Stability**: Quick Sort is not stable; equal elements may not retain their relative order.
   - **In-Place Sorting**: Yes, it sorts the array in-place with minimal auxiliary memory.
   - **Pivot Selection**: Exam questions may focus on pivot selection strategies, as poor pivot selection leads to the worst-case complexity. Median-of-three or random pivot selections are often used to mitigate this.
   - **Exam Insight**: Quick Sort is commonly used due to its efficiency, especially in scenarios where in-place sorting is needed, but candidates should understand when and why the worst case occurs.
   - **Additional Detail**: Quick Sort is particularly effective with cache optimization due to its in-place nature, making it faster in practice than Merge Sort for arrays stored in memory.

### 4. **Heap Sort**
   - **Concept**: Heap Sort builds a max-heap from the array and repeatedly extracts the maximum element (root of the heap), placing it at the end of the array and reducing the heap size by one each time.
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - **Best, Average, and Worst Case**: O(n log n), as heapify operations are O(log n) and are performed n times.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as Heap Sort is in-place and doesn’t require additional space for heap manipulation.
   - **Stability**: Heap Sort is not stable, as the ordering of equal elements is not preserved.
   - **In-Place Sorting**: Yes, it sorts the array in-place.
   - **Heap Construction**: Building the initial heap takes O(n) time, which is important in analyzing its overall time complexity.
   - **Exam Insight**: Heap Sort is particularly useful when constant space is a requirement. It is often compared with Merge and Quick Sort due to its efficiency and in-place property.
   - **Additional Detail**: Unlike Merge Sort and Quick Sort, Heap Sort is not well-suited for linked lists due to its dependence on random access, making it primarily suited for arrays.
